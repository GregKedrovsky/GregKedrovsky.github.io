# GregKedrovsky.github.io

Working on learning the workflow for getting pages up... 

Use this as the landing page... then link to other sub-landing pages (hub sections). Example:
1. PenTest Reports (write ups of TryHackMe, HTB, VulnHub, etc.)
2. [Blog Page](https://gregkedrovsky.github.io/Blog/) or [Blog Repo](https://github.com/GregKedrovsky/Blog)
3. Recipes (yes, I like food...)
4. Cheat Sheets
5. Projects (e.g., NIDS db harvester)
6. Etc.
